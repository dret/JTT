# JSON Training/Track Format (JTT)

The *JSON Training/Track Format (JTT)* is intended to be a JSON-based alternative to the existing XML-based formats for training and GPS data. The two most relevant existing formats in that space are the [GPS Exchange Format (GPX)](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) and [Training Center Database XML (TCX)](http://www.garmindeveloper.com/schemas/tcx/v2/).

Some parts of the format may require extensible vocabularies (such as activity types and data types), which may end up being managed via a registry and extensibility rules (such as the ones [defined in RFC 5988](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988#section-4)). [Activity types](activity-types) and [data types](data-types) are currently being considered for being managed via a registry.
