# JSON Training/Track Format (JTT)

The *JSON Training/Track Format (JTT)* is intended to be a JSON-based alternative to the existing XML-based formats for training and GPS data. The two most relevant existing formats in that space are [GPS Exchange Format (GPX)](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) and [Training Center Database XML (TCX)](http://www.garmindeveloper.com/schemas/tcx/v2/).
