# Existing Activity Types

This is an [overview](overview.md) of existing activity types in services and APIs.

The [overview](overview.md) is generated from [a single XML](types.xml) via [XSLT](types.xsl). This means that for adding a new API, it needs to be added to the [(hopefully self-describing) XML](types.xml), and then XML is transformed via [XSLT](types.xsl) to generate an updated [overview of all APIs](overview.md), and an updated set of [API details](API).
