# JTT Well-known Activity Types

This is an [overview](overview.md) of existing activity types in services and APIs.

The [overview](overview.md) is generated from [a single XML](activity-types.xml) via [XSLT](activity-types.xsl). For adding a new API, it needs to be added to the [(hopefully self-describing) XML](activity-types.xml), and then the XML is transformed via [XSLT](activity-types.xsl) to generate an updated [overview of all APIs](overview.md), and an updated set of [API details](API).
